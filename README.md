# Campaign Smart Contract

This project uses Solidity, React.js, Next.js and Semantic UI React.

This repo uses web3 to create a Kickstart clone but on the blockchain! 

## Step 1: Create the Smart Contract

The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The program used for this is Solidity. 

### Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language created specifically by the 
Ethereum Network team for constructing and designing smart contracts on Blockchain platforms.

## Step 2: Compiling & Deploying the Smart Contract

Needed to deploy: 
1)  Mnemonic Phrase
2) [Infura Endpoint](https://infura.io/dashboard) 

Save the address the contract was deployed to.  This instance of the contract will be used to create the frontend without having to redeploy. 

## Step 3:  Creating the FrontEnd

The front end of the application uses Reactjs, Nextjs, and Semantic UI React.

### Next.js

Next.js is a React framework for production.  It can be used for hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.

`npm install next react react-dom`

`yarn add next react react-dom`

`pnpm add next react react-dom`

[Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/)

### Semantic UI React

[Documentation](https://react.semantic-ui.com/)

When installing Semantic UI, also, install the semantic-ui-css.

`npm install semantic-ui-react semantic-ui-css`

Import the css link into the Head tag in Index.js
